# SwerveBase

![Build](https://github.com/FRCTeam834/SwerveBase/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

A base for future swerve code. Also implements new features such as pose estimation, driver profiling, and robot modes.

## Terminology note

SwerveBase code uses the word "angle" to describe the angle of the pivot of the module in degrees. It also uses "velocity" to describe the speed of the wheel in m/s (meters per second). Speed, RPM, or radians should not be used.
